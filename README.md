# WSRP24 Constructing combinators for arithmetic and arbitrary-length bitwise operations
 This project first explores the use of SK combinators to perform arithmetic operations on Church numerals. The project determines their size and time complexity and verifies their optimality through various ways. Several efficient combinators are also found. The project then proposes a new method to construct SK combinators for binary representations of arbitrary length efficiently and bitwise operations. At the end, the project compares their efficiency and performance to do basic arithmetic.
